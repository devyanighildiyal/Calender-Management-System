Introduction:
This project is all about software for the Calendar management system. It helps to manage the calendar between teachers and students.

Aim:
To take schedules or time tables of two people (teacher and student) and manage it to find the time during which both the parties would be available for a meeting by seeing the time occupied and taking in considerations the daily bounds

Plan For Implementation:
This is a 2-user input program. The teacher and student will input their respective time tables and the program will display the time slots in which both of them are free. This time slot would depend on the option selected by the student for example 5 minutes for a doubt, 2 minutes for general query and 45 minutes to an hour for any conceptual problem. The teacher would have the authorization to add, delete and change slots. 

Type of Data:
MySQL Database
